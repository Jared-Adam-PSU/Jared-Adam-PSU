My name is Jared Adam and I am currently a master's student in the Entomology Department At Penn State. At present, I am funded through the [Precision Sustainable Agrictlure](https://www.precisionsustainableag.org/) grant from the USDA. I am responsible for managing the entomology component of Common Experiment 2, which includes 16 colaborating Universities. I operate as the main contact for data collection/ protocol issues, act as discipline lead for our planning of the project and paper, as well as manage the data flow and analyses for the all entmmology-based data. 

Along with this, I am currently wokring on several smaller projects to evaluate the contributions of true spiders in biological control of conventional corn and soybean systems. 

I am planning to join the LRES department at Montana State for a PhD with Will Wetzel in Fall 2024.

    - I am also developing a project using microarthropods as biological indicators to evaluate agroecosystem quality
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
    - How to teach R
      - TA'd a graduate-level intro to coding and statistics course for Dr. Sara Hermann in Fall 2023
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
