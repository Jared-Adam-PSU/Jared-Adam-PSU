My name is Jared Adam and I am currently a master's student in the Entomology Department At Penn State. At present, I am funded through the Precision Sustainable Agrictlure grant from the USDA. I am responsible for managing the entomology component of Common Experiment 2, which includes 17 colaborating Universities. I operate as the main contact for data collection/ protocol issues, act as discipline lead for our planning of the project and paper, as well as manage the data flow and analyses for the all entmmology-based data. 

Along with this, I am currently wokring on several other smaller projects to evaluate the contributions of true spiders in biological control of conventional agronomic systems. 

I am hoping to begin a PhD shortly after completing my masters degree in Spring/ Summer of 2024.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
    - Evaluating how cover crops influence arthropod-natural enemy populations with different agronmic cropping systems 
    - I am most interested in true spiders and their role withim the IPM toolbox 
    - Also developing a project using microarthropods as biological indicators within different agricultural systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
    - How to teach R
      - Will be TAing for a a graduate-level intro to coding and statistics course for Dr. Sara Hermann in Fall 2023
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 
    - Plant and insect population monitoring projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
    - Machine learning for ecology/ population dynamics     
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
